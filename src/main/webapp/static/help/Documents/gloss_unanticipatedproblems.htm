<p class="C1HPopupTopicText">Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all 
of the following criteria: (1) unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or 
frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the <a id="popup_17491" onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" href="gloss_protocol.htm">protocol</a>-related documents, such as the <a id="popup_17493" onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" href="gloss_irb.htm">IRB</a>-approved research protocol and informed consent 
document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 
(2) related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this 
guidance document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that 
the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures 
involved in the research); and (3) suggests that the research places subjects or 
others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, 
or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. See also Adverse 
Events, <a id="popup_17492" onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" href="gloss_ohrp.htm">OHRP</a> Guidance.<b></b></p></body></html>
