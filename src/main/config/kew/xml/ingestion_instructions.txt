run the following to clear out the kew tables 

delete from krew_rule_t;
delete from krew_rule_tmpl_t;
delete from krew_doc_typ_t;
commit;

the kew files are organized in a hierarchy like so.

           1 (KualiDocument.xml)
          / \
(KC.xml) 2   2
        / \ / \
       3  33   3 (AwardDocument.xml)
       
You can zip each folder and use the rice ingester to reingest the hierarchy.
You must start with the lowest numbered folder and work your way down.

Given the current implementation of the rice ingester you could also zip up all the numbered directories
and feed that into the rice ingester.  That will ingest everything in the
correct order b/c of the current directory names.  (this may not work across platforms)...

Note: Currently, the directory structure is flat to allow the xml files
to be simply zipped.  Organizing the files like base_dir/1/2/3/4/5 does not
work with the current implementation of the rice ingester.
