Post Release 2.0 Patch Summary
------------------------------

POST-2_0-2010-05-15.sql: Adds missing role member attributes for Proposal Log roles.  
                         Apply only if quickstart is retained from bundled install.

POST-2_0-2010-05-20.sql: Removes Role Permissions where role id is null, adds View 
                         Award Budget to Award Budget Approver, and removes not null
                         constraint from LAST_UPDT_DT columns in all tables.
                         
POST-2_0-2010-05-27-*.sql: Adds missing sequence SEQUENCE_AWARD_ID. Note there are separate 
                           scripts for ORACLE and MYSQL. 
                           
POST-2_0-2010-07-15-*.sql: Updates foreign key columns such that the size of the data 
                           type matches.  This discrepancy did not affect Oracle as it is 
                           more tolerable than MySQL.
                           Added missing SEQUENCE_IPPCS_ID sequence.
                                                   
Note to sequences in Oracle:  OJB will create missing sequences in Oracle when they are
referenced.  Therefore when applying Oracle scripts on a database that has been used with
the Kuali Coeus application some sequences may not be successfully created because they
exist already.
