Whenever an investigator has a significant financial interest that might reasonably appear to be affected by the investigator's research, there is the potential for a conflict of interest. Starting October 1, 1995, NSF & NIH  regulations required that the existence, but not the amount, of significant financial interests of an investigator (and his or her immediate relatives) be disclosed to the Institute when the investigator applies for or receives support.   Beginning in June 2000, University is simplifying the information reporting which are required as a part of any proposal processed by the University and directed to NSF or any PHS agency.  In addition, the same forms used for proposal specific submissions will be utilized for the annual updates required by NSF and PHS.The disclosure level ($10,000) and the reach (aggregated for the investigator, investigator's spouse, and all dependent children) will require almost every PHS or NSF investigator to make a disclosure.  However, the requirement is to disclose the existence, not the amount, of financial interests which exceed the threshold.  The disclosure provides a measure of protection for both the investigator and the Institute.  Principal and co-investigators are required to complete a Financial Interest Disclosure and, if necessary, the actual financial interests must be disclosed.  This information must be completed to comply with the federal requirements for proposals submitted to NSF and PHS.<!--EOR-->Whenever an investigator has a significant financial interest that might reasonably appear to be affected by the investigator's research, there is the potential for a conflict of interest.
