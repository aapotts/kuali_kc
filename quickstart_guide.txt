*** Installing the out-of-the-box Kuali Coeus 3.0.1 distribution ***

Requirements:

	- Java 1.5
	- Servlet 2.4 / JSP 2.0 Compatible Servlet Container such as Apache Tomcat 5.5
	- Oracle database instance or MySQL database instance

1. Run the database scripts using the instructions provided in db_scripts/ReadMe.txt

2. Place binary/kc-config.xml in one of the configured default locations: {Userhome}/kuali/main/ptd/kc-config.xml OR /opt/sa_forms/java/ptd/kra/kc-config.xml.
   (NOTE: If you are upgrading and have an existing kc-config.xml in this location, please replace it, as new parameters are often added)
	* On Windows with Tomcat running as a service, the best location is usually c:\kuali\main\ptd
	* To use a different location, open kc-ptd.war and create an "alt.config.location" parameter in /WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/kc-config-build.xml.
	* You SHOULD also be able to pass a java parameter of alt.config.location to your j2ee container (not guaranteed to work)
	(NOTE: This file also contains the "build.environment" parameter referenced in the external kc-config.xml file as "environment")

3. Edit parameters in the external kc-config.xml (that you just placed in step #2) as desired.
	* You will at least need to fill in the following parameters with your database connection information: datasource.url, datasource.username, datasource.password.
	* You will also need to change application.host to your server's host name (i.e. kuali.yourinstitution.edu).
	* Other commonly changed parameters are: application.http.scheme, http.port and app.context.name (be sure app.context.name matches your deployed webapp -- normally the name of your war file)
	* If you are using SSL, be sure that application.http.scheme and http.port reflect this.
	* If you are using MySQL, see the MySQL changes at the end of this guide.
	* For embedded mode or further configuration, please consult the Kuali Coeus 3.0 User Manual online.

4. For Oracle: Obtain ojdbc14.jar from an oracle client install ({OracleHome}/jdbc/lib) or the Oracle website (http://www.oracle.com).
   For MySQL: Obtain the jar file for the appropriate MySQL jdbc driver from mysql.com.
   Copy the jdbc jar file into the common jar file library.
	* Example: For Tomcat 5.5, copy ojdbc14.jar into {tomcat install dir}/common/lib.

5. Deploy kc-ptd.war to your servlet container (see user guide for your particular servlet container).

6. The KC application should now be accessible at: {application.host}/{app.context.name} (as specified in the external kc-config.xml -- app.context.name is kc-ptd, if not overridden).

7. Login as 'admin' (click on a tab or option and the login screen will appear).

8. Ingest the KEW documents
	* Click the System Admin tab and then select XML Ingester from the Workflow pane.
	* Find the KEW zip files in the distribution package
		* They are located under KC-RELEASE-2_0-SCRIPT and KC-RELEASE-3_0-SCRIPT subdirectories under db_scripts
	* If you did a NEW install, you should ingest both 2.0 and 3.0 KEW zip files (in that order)
	* If you upgraded a 2.0 version of KC then only ingest the 3.0 KEW zip file
	* Ingestion can take several minutes per zip file, so it is recommended to only do one at a time

*** MySQL changes to external kc-config.xml file -- adjust datasource.url as needed to fit your install:

        <param name="datasource.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/kcdev</param>
        <param name="datasource.ojb.platform">MySQL</param>
